Here I wanted to create a kops user and kops group, adding the necessary access policies as in kubernete's page suggested. https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/aws/
Also I wanted to create AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey for kops user.
I have to do aws configure and need to find a way to do it in ec2 instance, either using terraform or user-data scripts.
